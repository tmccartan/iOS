Project Description

PULSE is a heart rate monitor app that uses Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to communicate to heart rate monitors and tracks the users heart rate over a given time. As well as tracking heart rate, the application gives other metrics such as calories burned and average heart rate over the length of the activity. The user can view past activities and can see the results from the activity.
